	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>
  Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. 
  A good algorithm should be time complexity efficient.
</p>

<p>
  Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses. 
  <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial when working with large data sets. 
  It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n).
